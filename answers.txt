Note: These answers apply to the COVID-19 simulation.
Q1: What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
A1: virus, int(pop_size), int(vacc_percentage), int(initial_infected)
Q2: What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
A2: Below 0%
Q3: What percentage of the population died from the virus?
A3: 0.0045662100456621%
Q4: Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
A4: 100
